1. Project Title:
PepsiCo Plant KPI Dashboard ‚Äì Manufacturing Efficiency & Sustainability Tracker

2. Short Description / Purpose:
This Power BI dashboard is designed to visualize and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for PepsiCo's manufacturing plant. It enables stakeholders and plant managers to track year-on-year operational performance, sustainability metrics, and resource utilization‚Äîhelping drive data-based decisions for improving efficiency and reducing wastage.

3. Tech Stack (with examples)
üü° Power BI: Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and creating interactive visualizations
üìó Excel/CSV: Used as the source format for raw plant data exports
üêô GitHub: Used for version control and project sharing
  Example:
Used Power BI to build visuals with dynamic filters (month/year) and created DAX measures to calculate AOP vs Actual variance, technical availability, and area-wise downtime summaries.

4. Data Source
A. Internal Plant Data exported from manufacturing systems in Excel/CSV format
B. Data range includes three years: 2022, 2023, and 2024
C. Key metrics covered:
  - Actual vs AOP consumption (Power, HSD, LPG, Rice Husk, Water)
  - Area-wise downtime data (Process, Packaging, Utility)
  - Production Volume (in Metric Tonnes)
  - Technical Availability (in percentage)
  
5. Features and Highlights
A. Time-based filtering
  - Allows monthly and yearly analysis using slicers for better performance comparison.
B. AOP vs Actual performance comparison
  - Helps visualize variances between planned (AOP) and actual values across resources.
C. Utility consumption tracking
  - Includes Power (kWh), HSD (liters), LPG (kg), Rice Husk (kg), and Water (kg/kg of production).
D. Area-wise downtime breakdown
  - Clearly shows downtime contribution from Process, Packaging, and Utility departments.
E. Production volume and technical availability
  - Displays total production output and equipment uptime for performance benchmarking.
F. Visual-driven decision support
  -Clean design and interactive elements make the dashboard usable for engineers, team leads, and plant heads with minimal training.

6. Business Problem and Solution
Business Problem:
The plant leadership lacked a consolidated view of year-over-year performance across utilities, downtimes, and production metrics. Manual data analysis using spreadsheets was time-consuming, error-prone, and non-visual.
Solution:
A centralized Power BI dashboard was developed that combines historical data, calculates key metrics, and visually presents performance indicators. This enabled data-driven reviews, faster RCA, proactive resource management, and increased visibility into problem areas.
Impact:
- Enabled 25% faster decision-making during monthly reviews
- Identified overconsumption trends early, saving operational costs
- Reduced manual reporting time by over 60%
  
7. Key Questions Answered by the Dashboard
- What is the month-on-month and year-on-year production trend?
- How do Actual vs AOP figures compare across utilities?
- Which area (Process, Packaging, Utility) is contributing the most to downtime?
- What is the overall technical availability of the plant?
- How is the plant performing against sustainability targets (like water and rice husk consumption)?
- Are there any seasonal spikes in fuel or water usage?
- Where can we take corrective actions to improve efficiency?
